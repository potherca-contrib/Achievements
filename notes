## Repositories

### Core

The "Core" repository is the code-base that contains the logic, templates,
basic layout/styling and documentation and examples.

It contains the following files:

_includes       <-- Template Logic
_layouts        <-- Templates
(?) assets (?)  <-- @TODO: Move all JS/CSS/etc. into a single folder?
css             <-- basic styling
    modules
    base-theme.css
    layout.css
js              <-- UI functionality
README.md       <-- Documentation
_config.yml     <-- Example configuration file
index.html      <-- Move "somehwere else" (?)


### Awards

The "Awards" repository is the code-base that the developers or an
organisation are interested so they can award badges. In order for this to work
the Core repository needs to be included as a git submodule and the config
needs to point to that submodule directory.


**_config.yml**

    core_directory: @{achievements-core-repo}
    includes_dir: core/_includes
    layouts_dir:  core/_layouts

It contains the following files:

    @{achievements-core-repo}   <--
    _config.yml                 <-- points to repository
    _data
        badges.json             <-- List of badges (name/url)
        members.json            <-- List of users  (department->user.name/image)
    _profiles                   <-- One file per user
    css
        custom-theme.css        <-- Organisation specific styling (colours, fonts, etc)
    [img]        (Optional)     <--  Member and Badge images. Images can be kept elsewhere
        badges                       and configured from the _data/*.json files
        member
